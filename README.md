mapbox-ios-sdk-WKT
==================

Quick example of adding WKT (Well-Known Text) to Mapbox iOS SDK

Note: it’s written in a hurry and it’s based on some ugly string manipulations.

Supported geometries:
POINT
MULTIPOINT
LINESTRING
MULTILINESTRING
POLYGON
MULTIPOLYGON


Note: Initially it was written to support also GEOMETRYCOLLECTION geometries, but not any more. Check the NSLogs for more info how to get the files with GC support.
